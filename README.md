# C-MAJOR-PROJECT
SNAKE GAME
This project is a console-based Snake Game implemented in C. The objective of the game is to control a snake, eat fruits to grow in length, and avoid colliding with the walls or the snake’s own tail. The game is fully playable on both Windows and Linux systems using terminal input/output.

The code is modularized into three parts:

Header file (snake.h) – Contains global variables, constants, and function declarations.

Function file (snake.c) – Implements game logic, drawing, input handling, and setup functions.

Main file (main.c) – Contains the main function and runs the game loop.
